		- segfault when doing a single redirection (in or out) without cmd;
		- freeze when doing multiple output redirection without cmd;
		- endless printing of prompt when doing multiple redirection including at least one input redirection, without cmd;
	- when redirectiong output to a file with no right, do cmd normaly
