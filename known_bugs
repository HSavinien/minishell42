list of bug we need to solve in minishell :

/tPIPES :


/tCHEVRONS :
	- (solved) no new prompt after a '<' or '<<' chevron : we can type stuff, but it does nothing;
	- (solved) multiple bugs when using chevrons without cmd :
		- (solved) segfault when doing a single redirection (in or out) without cmd;
		- (solved) freeze when doing multiple output redirection without cmd;
		- (solved) when doing multiple output redirection, second file is not created;
		- (solved) endless printing of prompt when doing multiple redirection including at least one input redirection, without cmd;
		- (solved) when doing multiple redirect with one input redir and some output redir, the first output file is not created. if there was only one output file, it says cmd not found.
	- (solved) when redirectiong output to a file with no right, do cmd normaly
	- heredocs (solved) :
		- (solved) do not put '\n' between lines
		- (solved) does not consider the first line of the input


/tLEXER_PARSER :
	- (solved) lexer can sometime add random char to line;
    - (solved) export PATH="$PATH::::::" va vider le PATH car le lexer va utiliser le nom de variable `PATH::::::`
	- (solved) echo Salut"$USER" va afficher des caracteres <?> a la position des guillemets alors qu'il devrait rien avoir. `Salut�cmaroude�`
	- (solved) cat|cat|cat les tokens sans espace devraient fonctionner.
	- (solved) $? is not yet handeled

/tGENERAL SYNTAXE :
	- (solved) no difference between 'echo "|" ls' and 'echo | ls'
	- (solved) no error message when cmd don't exist

/tBUILTINS :
	exit (solved) :
		- (solved) does not write 'exit' when used witout args
		- (solved) does not put an error message when confronted to an empty string
		- (solved) does not handle '+' sign in front of arg
		- (solved) a sign without a number behind is seen as a number (exit + is valid)
		- (solved) exit without arg should return last return value rather than 0.

/tERROR MANAGEMENT AND CODE:
	- (solved) signal ctrl+c should put $? at 1 if no command is running, 127 + cmd exit status else
	- (solved) cmd not found should return 127

/tOTHER :
	- (solved) leaked fd in the reset function
