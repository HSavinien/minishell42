CHEVRONS :
- no new prompt after a '<' chevron : we can type stuff, but it does nothing;
- multiple bugs when using chevrons without cmd :
	- segfault when doing a single redirection (in or out) without cmd;
	- freeze when doing multiple output redirection without cmd;
	- endless printing of prompt when doing multiple redirection including at least one input redirection, without cmd;
- when redirectiong output to a file with no right, do cmd normaly


LEXER_PARSER :
- lexer can sometime add random char to line;


GENERAL SYNTAXE :
- no difference between 'echo "|" ls' and 'echo | ls'
- no error message when cmd don't exist
